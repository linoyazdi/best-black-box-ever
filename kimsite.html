    <h1>Welcome to the official website of Kim Possible!</h1>
    <p>Hi there! I'm Kim Possible, international superhero and high school student. I'm here to save the world and still make it home in time for dinner.</p>
    <div class="card">
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <img src="kim-possible.jpg" alt="A photo of Kim Possible" width="10%" height="30%" display="block" margin="auto">
      <p>I'm a cheerleader, honor student, and all-around hero. With the help of my best friend Ron Stoppable and my trusty computer, Wade, I take on missions to stop villains and save the world.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h2>My Missions</h2>
      <p>I've tackled all sorts of missions, from stopping Dr. Drakken's evil plots to rescuing people from burning buildings. No mission is too big or too small for me to handle.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Stopped Dr. Drakken's plan to turn the world's leaders into monkeys</li>
        <li>Rescued Ron from the clutches of Monkey Fist</li>
        <li>Saved the world from the global warming machine</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Here are just a few of the villains I've faced:</p>
      <div class="villain-card">
        <img src="dr-drakken.png" alt="Dr. Drakken">
        <p>Dr. Drakken is a brilliant scientist turned supervillain. He's always coming up with new plots to take over the world, but I'm always ready to stop him.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="villain-card">
        <img src="monkey-fist.jpg" alt="Monkey Fist">
        <p>Monkey Fist is a wealthy scientist who uses his fortune to fund his evil schemes. He has a particular grudge against Ron, but I always make sure to save the day.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="villain-card">
        <img src="shego.jpg" alt="Shego">
        <p>Shego is a former member of Dr. Drakken's team and has powers of her own. She can generate powerful green energy blasts from her hands and is a formidable opponent in battle. However, I always find a way to outsmart her and save the day.</p>
