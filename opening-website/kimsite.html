    <h1>Welcome to the official website of Kim Possible!</h1>
    <p>Hi there! I'm Kim Possible, international superhero and high school student. I'm here to save the world and still make it home in time for dinner.</p>
    <div class="card">
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <img src="kim-possible.jpg" alt="A photo of Kim Possible" width="10%" height="30%" display="block" margin="auto">
      <p>I'm a cheerleader, honor student, and all-around hero. With the help of my best friend Ron Stoppable and my trusty computer, Wade, I take on missions to stop villains and save the world.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h2>My Missions</h2>
      <p>I've tackled all sorts of missions, from stopping Dr. Drakken's evil plots to rescuing people from burning buildings. No mission is too big or too small for me to handle.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Stopped Dr. Drakken's plan to turn the world's leaders into monkeys</li>
        <li>Rescued Ron from the clutches of Monkey Fist</li>
        <li>Saved the world from the global warming machine</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Here are just a few of the villains I've faced:</p>
      <div class="villain-card">
        <img src="dr-drakken.png" alt="Dr. Drakken">
        <p>Dr. Drakken is a brilliant scientist turned supervillain. He's always coming up with new plots to take over the world, but I'm always ready to stop him.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="villain-card">
        <img src="monkey-fist.jpg" alt="Monkey Fist">
        <p>Monkey Fist is a wealthy scientist who uses his fortune to fund his evil schemes. He has a particular grudge against Ron, but I always make sure to save the day.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="villain-card">
        <img src="shego.jpg" alt="Shego">
        <p>Shego is a former member of Dr. Drakken's team and has powers of her own. She can generate powerful green energy blasts from her hands and is a formidable opponent in battle. However, I always find a way to outsmart her and save the day.</p>
      </div>
	  <div class="villain-card">
        <img src="Dementor.webp" alt="Professor Dementor">
        <p>Professor Dementor is a supervillain and mad scientist who seeks to dominate the world. He is a competitor of Dr. Drakken's, as they are similar in villainy style. However, Dementor seems to be more infamous, and notably better equipped, staffed, and financed, making him more successful on a regular basis.</p>
      </div>
	  <div class="villain-card">
		<img src="thanos.jpeg" alt="Thanos">
		<p>Thanos is a genocidal warlord from Titan, whose objective was to bring stability to the universe by wiping out half of all life at every level, as he believed its massive population would inevitably use up the universe's entire supply of resources and perish.</p>
	  </div>
	  <div class="villain-card">
        <img src="voldemort.jpg" alt="Voldermort">
        <p>Tom Marvolo Riddle, later known as Lord Voldemort or, alternatively as the Dark Lord, You-Know-Who, or He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named was an English half-blood wizard considered to have been the most powerful and dangerous Dark wizard of all time. He was amongst the greatest wizards to have ever lived, often considered more powerful or equal to Albus Dumbledore.</p>
      </div>
	  <div class="villain-card">
		<img src="dr-heinz-doofenshmirtz.webp" alt="Dr. Doofenshmirtz">
		<p>Dr. Doofenshmirtz is the head of Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated, and he tends not to be evil in the traditional sense, but rather overly dramatic, eccentric and generally clueless. His usual lair is an office building that he apparently owns, though he's worked from other locations when necessary for his plans.</p>
